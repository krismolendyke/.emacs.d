#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[[http://www.literateprogramming.com/][Literate programming]] is a methodology that combines a programming language
with a documentation language, thereby making programs more robust, more
portable, more easily maintained, and arguably more fun to write than programs
that are written only in a high-level language. The main idea is to treat a
program as a piece of literature, addressed to human beings rather than to a
computer. The program is also viewed as a hypertext document, rather like the
World Wide Web. (Indeed, I used the word WEB for this purpose long before CERN
grabbed it!) -- [[http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/lp.html][Donald Knuth]]

* Build Emacs
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: build-emacs
  :END:

  I primarily use Emacs locally on Apple hardware.  Most, if not all,
  of the remote editing that I do is done via =tramp=.  I keep an eye
  on the [[http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/log/][log]] at the official Emacs [[http://git-scm.com/][git]] [[http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/][repository]].  When something
  interesting lands there I will build a fresh Emacs installation via
  [[http://brew.sh/][Homebrew]] and try it out.

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    brew info emacs
  #+END_SRC

  I install Emacs with the following options.  The standard Homebrew
  installation has lost a lot of MacOS customization flags over the
  years so I've switched to the [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus][Emacs Plus]] formula instead.  First,
  tap that keg:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
  #+END_SRC

  And then install:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    brew install emacs-plus@29
  #+END_SRC

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    brew uninstall emacs
  #+END_SRC

** Emacs Source Directory

   =source-directory= is helpful to have set properly when exploring built-in
   /C functions/ via =find-function=.

   Finding the source code directory via Homebrew can be done with the
   following command:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports both
     echo $(brew --cache)/emacs*
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : /Library/Caches/Homebrew/emacs--git

   /Note/: =source-directory= must be set during Emacs initialization time to
   persist.  See [[https://github.com/krismolendyke/.emacs.d/blob/1241a848cee7dadfa0c719643925fa0a7b86f476/init.el#L84-L86][=init.el=]].

* How this works
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: how-this-works
  :END:

  The [[https://github.com/krismolendyke/.emacs.d/blob/master/init.el][=init.el=]] file bootstraps the entire process.  It is found by
  Emacs automatically if it is located in one of several well-defined
  locations.

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  When Emacs is started, it normally tries to load a Lisp program from
  an "initialization file", or "init file" for short.  This file, if
  it exists, specifies how to initialize Emacs for you.  Emacs looks
  for your init file using the filenames `~/.emacs', `~/.emacs.el', or
  `~/.emacs.d/init.el'; you can choose to use any one of these three
  names (*note Find Init::).  Here, `~/' stands for your home
  directory. -- [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html][The Emacs Initialization File]]
  #+END_QUOTE

  Once it's found, =init.el= sets "global" variables and defines
  several functions to be executed /during/ initialization and one
  that should be executed /after/ initialization has completed.
  =k20e/after-init-hook= is a hook run after initialization.  The most
  interesting bit of this function is the call to
  =org-babel-load-file=:

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  (org-babel-load-file FILE &optional COMPILE)

  Load Emacs Lisp source code blocks in the Org-mode FILE. This
  function exports the source code using `org-babel-tangle' and then
  loads the resulting file using `load-file'.  With prefix arg
  (noninteractively: 2nd arg) COMPILE the tangled Emacs Lisp file to
  byte-code before it is loaded.
  #+END_QUOTE

  This function invocation exports all [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Working-With-Source-Code.html#Working-With-Source-Code][=org-mode= source blocks]] in any
  =org-mode= files in the =.emacs.d= directory to a single Emacs Lisp
  file and then instructs Emacs to load that file.  [[https://github.com/krismolendyke/.emacs.d/blob/master/custom.org][=custom.org=]] is
  the biggest of those =org-mode= files and … /this/ is that file!

** HTML Export =post-commit= Hook

   This [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks][git =post-commit= hook]] is located at =.git/hooks/post-commit=
   and automatically generates the HTML content of this [[https://pages.github.com/][GitHub Pages]]
   site.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     #!/bin/sh

     emacs --batch \
           --directory '~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/org-mode/lisp' \

     git checkout gh-pages
     mv custom.html index.html
     git add index.html
     git commit --message "post-commit hook regeneration."
     git checkout master
   #+END_SRC

   All of the interesting customization of the exported document is
   performed in [[https://github.com/krismolendyke/.emacs.d/blob/master/elisp/k20e-org-html-export.el][=elisp/k20e-org-html-export.el=]].

* Customization

  I don't make much use of the [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Customization.html#Customization][Customization]] interface.  By default it dumps
  its settings into =init.el= and I don't want to see them there.  A few
  packages that I use do rely on customization so I do need it to be loaded.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq custom-file (expand-file-name ".emacs-custom.el" user-emacs-directory))
    (load custom-file)
  #+END_SRC

* use-package

  Before =use-package= I had 70 packages installed and
  =emacs-init-time= was ="8.678111 seconds"=.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (eval-when-compile (require 'use-package))

  #+END_SRC

* Performance Tuning

  Mucking with these solely based on output from =lsp-doctor= and its
  recommendations since I use this all day writing Go programs.

* Global GNU Emacs Key Bindings

  These global key bindings override /built-in/ functions only.
  Package-specific or custom function defunition key bindings are made in
  their own dedicated sections where other specific settings are made.

** Unset

   OS X annoyance -- =C-M-d= is a "hot key" bound to dictionary lookup
   and masks the key binding in Emacs.  [[http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/22785/how-do-i-disable-the-command-control-d-word-definition-keyboard-shortcut-in-os-x/114269#114269][Disabling it]] can currently
   only be done by editing a default /and restarting/.

** Export

   - https://github.com/dakrone/ox-tufte
   - https://github.com/tsdye/tufte-org-mode

   Most non-interactive export settings are defined in [[https://github.com/krismolendyke/.emacs.d/blob/master/elisp/k20e-org-html-export.el][a file loaded
   during initialization]].  Those settings are defined during
   initialization time to support a fast batch process for exporting
   /this/ document to HTML in a Git =post-commit= hook.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'k20e-org-html-export)
   #+END_SRC

   Interactive customization can be done here.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'ox-publish)

     (setq
      ;; Enable "expert" export interface.
      org-export-dispatch-use-expert-ui t

      ;; Continue export when links are broken, but mark them
      org-export-with-broken-links  `mark)
   #+END_SRC

*** Options

    A message in =*Messages*= like:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      user-error: Unable to resolve link: nil
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    indicates that a link somewhere is malformed.  Adding the option:

    #+BEGIN_SRC org
      ,#+OPTIONS: broken-links:mark
    #+END_SRC

    and exporting will insert =BROKEN= into the HTML document.
    Searching for that token makes finding the offending broken link
    much easier.  Keeping this option set all the time would let
    broken links slip through the export process undetected.

** =ControlPath=

   Fix =ControlPath too long= errors due to OS X pitching a [[https://lists.macosforge.org/pipermail/macports-tickets/2011-June/084295.html][long temporary directory]] to =ssh=.

   Unfortunately, setting this is blowing up the =server-start= which
   can no longer find the socket stored in the original =TMPDIR=
   value.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; (setenv "TMPDIR" "/tmp")
   #+END_SRC

   Eureka!  It appears that the =ControlMaster= option for =ssh=
   should be set to =yes= instead of =auto= to avoid the =ControlPath
   too long= error.  Here is the interesting section of =man 5
   ssh_config=:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     ControlMaster
                  Enables the sharing of multiple sessions over a single network connection.  When set to
                  ``yes'', ssh(1) will listen for connections on a control socket specified using the
                  ControlPath argument.  Additional sessions can connect to this socket using the same
                  ControlPath with ControlMaster set to ``no'' (the default).  These sessions will try to reuse
                  the master instance's network connection rather than initiating new ones, but will fall back
                  to connecting normally if the control socket does not exist, or is not listening.

                  Setting this to ``ask'' will cause ssh to listen for control connections, but require confir-
                  mation using the SSH_ASKPASS program before they are accepted (see ssh-add(1) for details).
                  If the ControlPath cannot be opened, ssh will continue without connecting to a master
                  instance.

                  X11 and ssh-agent(1) forwarding is supported over these multiplexed connections, however the
                  display and agent forwarded will be the one belonging to the master connection i.e. it is not
                  possible to forward multiple displays or agents.

                  Two additional options allow for opportunistic multiplexing: try to use a master connection
                  but fall back to creating a new one if one does not already exist.  These options are:
                  ``auto'' and ``autoask''.  The latter requires confirmation like the ``ask'' option.
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   The =tramp-ssh-controlmaster-options= variable is responsible for
   the =ControlMaster= value as well as a few other options which have
   not been changed from their default values.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq tramp-ssh-controlmaster-options
           "-o ControlPath=%t.%%r@%%h:%%p -o ControlMaster=yes -o ControlPersist=no")

   cannot be read= errors.

   #+END_SRC

** File Backup

   Do not backup files edited by =tramp= to [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/tramp/Auto_002dsave-and-Backup.html][avoid possibly sharing
   copies of privileged files with non-privileged users]].
